## WASTE MANAGEMENT IN KIGALI CITY
Despite Kigali City’s strong commitment to cleanliness and environmental protection, household waste management remains a challenge in many areas. Some households do not properly separate waste, others experience irregular waste collection services, and some residents have limited awareness of waste management rules and best practices.
Improper waste management can lead to environmental pollution, public health risks, blocked drainage systems, and increased waste management costs.
However, there is limited household-level data on waste generation, waste separation practices, awareness levels, and challenges faced by residents in Kigali City. Without such data, it is difficult for authorities and service providers to design effective waste management interventions.
This study aims to address this gap by collecting and analyzing household waste management data using a KoboToolbox survey,PostgreSQLand PowerBI.

Objectives of this study is 
to identify the most common types of household waste generated in Kigali City,
to determine the level of household waste separation practices,
to assess the frequency and methods of waste collection services,
to evaluate residents’ awareness of waste management rules and guidelines,
to identify challenges faced by households in managing waste,
to examine residents’ attitudes toward proper waste management and environmental protection.
And this study will be useful to Kigali City Authorities to improve waste management policies and monitoring strategies.
